## Autonomous Micromouse Robot - Electronic System Redesign

# Overview
This repository documents the development of the electronic systems for an autonomous Micromouse robot, developed as a member of an academic robotics team. The project represents a strategic hardware iteration from the legacy Version 1 architecture to a high-performance framework, specifically engineered to meet the reliability and precision requirements of autonomous maze navigation.

# Objectives
The primary objective is to engineer a hardware solution that addresses the systemic limitations of the previous generation. This development prioritizes optimized power distribution, enhanced signal integrity for sensor arrays, and improved structural integration. The goal is to establish a robust hardware foundation capable of supporting advanced motion control and mapping algorithms.

# Status
The project is currently in the requirements definition and preliminary research phase. Efforts are directed toward the analytical review of Version 1 performance and the formal specification of the new architecture. Formal schematic capture and layout design will commence following the validation of these technical requirements.

# Tools
Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is conducted via KiCad. The project adheres to strict version control standards through Git to ensure design traceability and maintain the technical documentation integrity expected within an academic research environment.
